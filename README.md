  > ### Leaflet
  ``` java 
    Leaflet is the leading open source JavaScript library for mobile friendly interactive maps. 
    Weighing just about 39 KB of JS, it has all the mapping features most developers ever need.

    Leaflet is designed with simplicity, performance and usability in mind. It works efficiently across all major 
    desktop and mobile platforms,can be extended with lots of plugins, has a beautiful, easy to use and well 
    documented API and a simple, readable source code that is a joy to contribute to.
    
    Here we create a map in the 'map' div, add tiles of our choice, and then add a marker with some text in a popup.

 ```
